            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <img src="assets/images/PortfolioIMG.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Diana W Lam">
      <p>Hello, world! My name is Diana W Lam and I'm currently learning how to bea full-stack web developer.</p> 

      <p>Right now, I'm enrolled in a coding bootcamp in the process of making a career change from the management and operations industry of a company. I have over a decade of experience in customer service and management and have honed a diverse set of transferable skills to become a succesful developer.</p>

      <p>Within the management world, Iâ€™ve worked in fast-paced, deadline-oriented environments with responsibilities including leading a team, meeting deadlines, quality control, and project management. I have a track record of establishing successful editorial priorities for the team and overseeing implementation of effective process optimization plans. I'm naturally meticulous and comfortable working under tight schedules, so I produce high quality, accurate work with fast turnaround times. I excel at learning new tasks, adapt quickly to changing workflows, and leverage strategy, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills to tackle challenges.</p>

      <p>My work in long-term disability insurance and the beauty industry has provided me with strong experience in a client-facing role. This taught me to ensure the mindset of the client to ensure further revenue as the best ideas not only come from the clientele but also help build the trust in the company I am working for to further the business.</p>
      <h3>Fun Facts!</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I'm a Salem, MA native. This just essentially means that I could be a witch. </li>
        <li>I can't live without: family, video games, and cars.</li>
        <li>I love to eat. So much so, that I try to learn a lot of recipes on my own. My son and I also frequently go on dates together to explore the restaurants and food near us. (Sometimes we will even travel far for it.)</li>       
        <li>I love to workout and keep a healthy lifestyle.</li>
        <li>I did nails as a manicurist for 12 plus years.</li>
      </ul>
